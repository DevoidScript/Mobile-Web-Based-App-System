PWA Icon Requirements:

Please add the following icon files to this directory:

1. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels) - Required for PWA installation
2. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels) - Required for PWA installation
3. badge.png (96x96 pixels) - Used for notifications

These icons should be:
- Square with no transparent padding
- Have rounded corners if desired
- Use the app's primary color (#4285f4) as background

For best results, design a simple, recognizable logo that works well at small sizes.

You can generate these icons from a single source image using tools like:
