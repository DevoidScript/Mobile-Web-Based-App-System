PWA Screenshot Requirements:

Please add the following screenshot files to this directory:

1. mobile.png (750x1334 pixels) - Mobile screenshot for app stores
2. desktop.png (1280x800 pixels) - Desktop screenshot for app stores

These screenshots should:
- Show the main UI of your application
- Be clear, high-quality images
- Demonstrate the key features of your app
- Have consistent styling

Good screenshots help users understand your app before installing it.
They are displayed in app stores and installation prompts.
